# kfbypass
Killing Floor perk progression bypass and dlc unlocker.

Normally servers that use [non whitelisted](https://wiki.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php/List_of_mutators_(Killing_Floor)) mutators or maps block your perk progression and ability to earn achievements. This simple mod bypasses it.

## Installation
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/LebiFur/kfbypass/releases/latest) and drop all the files from the zip in the game's System folder and replace `binkw32.dll`.

## Usage
You can enable or disable dlc unlocking feature in `kfbypass.ini`.

## Known issues
With dlc unlocking enabled using any dlc character will crash the game and subsequently crash on start up. Delete the character line in `user.ini` to recover. For now the dlc unlocking feature is only meant for dlc weapons.
